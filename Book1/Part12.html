<p>Having established these distinctions we car now proceed to the sequel.
If there are thing!
capable both of being and of not being, there must be some definite maximum time of their being and not being; a time, I mean, during which continued existence is possible to them and a time during which continued nonexistence is possible.
And this is true in every category, whether the thing is, for example, 'man', or 'white', or 'three cubits long', or whatever it may be.
For if the time is not definite in quantity, but longer than any that can be suggested and shorter than none, then it will be possible for one and the same thing to exist for infinite time and not to exist for another infinity.
This, however, is impossible.</p>
<p>Let us take our start from this point.
The impossible and the false have not the same significance.
One use of 'impossible' and 'possible', and 'false' and 'true', is hypothetical.
It is impossible, for instance, on a certain hypothesis that the triangle should have its angles equal to two right angles, and on another the diagonal is commensurable.
But there are also things possible and impossible, false and true, absolutely.
Now it is one thing to be absolutely false, and another thing to be absolutely impossible.
To say that you are standing when you are not standing is to assert a falsehood, but not an impossibility.
Similarly to say that a man who is playing the harp, but not singing, is singing, is to say what is false but not impossible.
To say, however, that you are at once standing and sitting, or that the diagonal is commensurable, is to say what is not only false but also impossible.
Thus it is not the same thing to make a false and to make an impossible hypothesis, and from the impossible hypothesis impossible results follow.
A man has, it is true, the capacity at once of sitting and of standing, because when he possesses the one he also possesses the other; but it does not follow that he can at once sit and stand, only that at another time he can do the other also.
But if a thing has for infinite time more than one capacity, another time is impossible and the times must coincide.
Thus if a thing which exists for infinite time is destructible, it will have the capacity of not being.
Now if it exists for infinite time let this capacity be actualized; and it will be in actuality at once existent and non-existent.
Thus a false conclusion would follow because a false assumption was made, but if what was assumed had not been impossible its consequence would not have been impossible.</p>
<p>Anything then which always exists is absolutely imperishable.
It is also ungenerated, since if it was generated it will have the power for some time of not being.
For as that which formerly was, but now is not, or is capable at some future time of not being, is destructible, so that which is capable of formerly not having been is generated.
But in the case of that which always is, there is no time for such a capacity of not being, whether the supposed time is finite or infinite; for its capacity of being must include the finite time since it covers infinite time.</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible that one and the same thing should be capable of always existing and of always not-existing.
And 'not always existing', the contradictory, is also excluded.
Thus it is impossible for a thing always to exist and yet to be destructible.
Nor, similarly, can it be generated.
For of two attributes if B cannot be present without A, the impossibility A of proves the impossibility of B.
What always is, then, since it is incapable of ever not being, cannot possibly be generated.
But since the contradictory of 'that which is always capable of being' 'that which is not always capable of being'; while 'that which is always capable of not being' is the contrary, whose contradictory in turn is 'that which is not always capable of not being', it is necessary that the contradictories of both terms should be predicable of one and the same thing, and thus that, intermediate between what always is and what always is not, there should be that to which being and not-being are both possible; for the contradictory of each will at times be true of it unless it always exists.
Hence that which not always is not will sometimes be and sometimes not be; and it is clear that this is true also of that which cannot always be but sometimes is and therefore sometimes is not.
One thing, then, will have the power of being, and will thus be intermediate between the other two.</p>
<p>Expresed universally our argument is as follows.
Let there be two attributes, A and B, not capable of being present in any one thing together, while either A or C and either B or D are capable of being present in everything.
Then C and D must be predicated of everything of which neither A nor B is predicated.
Let E lie between A and B; for that which is neither of two contraries is a mean between them.
In E both C and D must be present, for either A or C is present everywhere and therefore in E. Since then A is impossible, C must be present, and the same argument holds of D.</p>
<p>Neither that which always is, therefore, nor that which always is not is either generated or destructible.
And clearly whatever is generated or destructible is not eternal.
If it were, it would be at once capable of always being and capable of not always being, but it has already been shown that this is impossible.
Surely then whatever is ungenerated and in being must be eternal, and whatever is indestructible and in being must equally be so.
(I use the words 'ungenerated' and 'indestructible' in their proper sense, 'ungenerated' for that which now is and could not at any previous time have been truly said not to be; 'indestructible' for that which now is and cannot at any future time be truly said not to be.)
If, again, the two terms are coincident, if the ungenerated is indestructible, and the indestructible ungenearted, then each of them is coincident with 'eternal'; anything ungenerated is eternal and anything indestructible is eternal.
This is clear too from the definition of the terms, Whatever is destructible must be generated; for it is either ungenerated, or generated, but, if ungenerated, it is by hypothesis indestructible.
Whatever, further, is generated must be destructible.
For it is either destructible or indestructible, but, if indestructible, it is by hypothesis ungenerated.</p>
<p>If, however, 'indestructible' and 'ungenerated' are not coincident, there is no necessity that either the ungenerated or the indestructible should be eternal.
But they must be coincident, for the following reasons.
The terms 'generated' and 'destructible' are coincident; this is obvious from our former remarks, since between what always is and what always is not there is an intermediate which is neither, and that intermediate is the generated and destructible.
For whatever is either of these is capable both of being and of not being for a definite time: in either case, I mean, there is a certain period of time during which the thing is and another during which it is not.
Anything therefore which is generated or destructible must be intermediate.
Now let A be that which always is and B that which always is not, C the generated, and D the destructible.
Then C must be intermediate between A and B.
For in their case there is no time in the direction of either limit, in which either A is not or B is.
But for the generated there must be such a time either actually or potentially, though not for A and B in either way.
C then will be, and also not be, for a limited length of time, and this is true also of D, the destructible.
Therefore each is both generated and destructible.
Therefore 'generated' and 'destructible' are coincident.
Now let E stand for the ungenerated, F for the generated, G for the indestructible, and H for the destructible.
As for F and H, it has been shown that they are coincident.
But when terms stand to one another as these do, F and H coincident, E and F never predicated of the same thing but one or other of everything, and G and H likewise, then E and G must needs be coincident.
For suppose that E is not coincident with G, then F will be, since either E or F is predictable of everything.
But of that of which F is predicated H will be predicable also.
H will then be coincident with G, but this we saw to be impossible.
And the same argument shows that G is coincident with E.</p>
<p>Now the relation of the ungenerated (E) to the generated (F) is the same as that of the indestructible (G) to the destructible (H).
To say then that there is no reason why anything should not be generated and yet indestructible or ungenerated and yet destroyed, to imagine that in the one case generation and in the other case destruction occurs once for all, is to destroy part of the data.
For (1) everything is capable of acting or being acted upon, of being or not being, either for an infinite, or for a definitely limited space of time; and the infinite time is only a possible alternative because it is after a fashion defined, as a length of time which cannot be exceeded.
But infinity in one direction is neither infinite or finite.
(2) Further, why, after always existing, was the thing destroyed, why, after an infinity of not being, was it generated, at one moment rather than another?
If every moment is alike and the moments are infinite in number, it is clear that a generated or destructible thing existed for an infinite time.
It has therefore for an infinite time the capacity of not being (since the capacity of being and the capacity of not being will be present together), if destructible, in the time before destruction, if generated, in the time after generation.
If then we assume the two capacities to be actualized, opposites will be present together.
(3) Further, this second capacity will be present like the first at every moment, so that the thing will have for an infinite time the capacity both of being and of not being; but this has been shown to be impossible.
(4) Again, if the capacity is present prior to the activity, it will be present for all time, even while the thing was as yet ungenerated and non-existent, throughout the infinite time in which it was capable of being generated.
At that time, then, when it was not, at that same time it had the capacity of being, both of being then and of being thereafter, and therefore for an infinity of time.</p>
<p>It is clear also on other grounds that it is impossible that the destructible should not at some time be destroyed.
For otherwise it will always be at once destructible and in actuality indestructible, so that it will be at the same time capable of always existing and of not always existing.
Thus the destructible is at some time actually destroyed.
The generable, similarly, has been generated, for it is capable of having been generated and thus also of not always existing.</p>
<p>We may also see in the following way how impossible it is either for a thing which is generated to be thenceforward indestructible, or for a thing which is ungenerated and has always hitherto existed to be destroyed.
Nothing that is by chance can be indestructible or ungenerated, since the products of chance and fortune are opposed to what is, or comes to be, always or usually, while anything which exists for a time infinite either absolutely or in one direction, is in existence either always or usually.
That which is by chance, then, is by nature such as to exist at one time and not at another.
But in things of that character the contradictory states proceed from one and the same capacity, the matter of the thing being the cause equally of its existence and of its non-existence.
Hence contradictories would be present together in actuality.</p>
<p>Further, it cannot truly be said of a thing now that it exists last year, nor could it be said last year that it exists now.
It is therefore impossible for what once did not exist later to be eternal.
For in its later state it will possess the capacity of not existing, only not of not existing at a time when it exists-since then it exists in actuality-but of not existing last year or in the past.
Now suppose it to be in actuality what it is capable of being.
It will then be true to say now that it does not exist last year.
But this is impossible.
No capacity relates to being in the past, but always to being in the present or future.
It is the same with the notion of an eternity of existence followed later by non-existence.
In the later state the capacity will be present for that which is not there in actuality.
Actualize, then, the capacity.
It will be true to say now that this exists last year or in the past generally.</p>
<p>Considerations also not general like these but proper to the subject show it to be impossible that what was formerly eternal should later be destroyed or that what formerly was not should later be eternal.
Whatever is destructible or generated is always alterable.
Now alteration is due to contraries, and the things which compose the natural body are the very same that destroy it.</p>
