## Part 5

Since the number of the elements must be limited, it remains to inquire whether there is more than one element.
Some assume one only, which is according to some water, to others air, to others fire, to others again something finer than water and denser than air, an infinite body-so they say-bracing all the heavens.

Now those who decide for a single element, which is either water or air or a body finer than water and denser than air, and proceed to generate other things out of it by use of the attributes density and rarity, all alike fail to observe the fact that they are depriving the element of its priority.
Generation out of the elements is, as they say, synthesis, and generation into the elements is analysis, so that the body with the finer parts must have priority in the order of nature.
But they say that fire is of all bodies the finest.
Hence fire will be first in the natural order.
And whether the finest body is fire or not makes no difference; anyhow it must be one of the other bodies that is primary and not that which is intermediate.
Again, density and rarity, as instruments of generation, are equivalent to fineness and coarseness, since the fine is rare, and coarse in their use means dense.
But fineness and coarseness, again, are equivalent to greatness and smallness, since a thing with small parts is fine and a thing with large parts coarse.
For that which spreads itself out widely is fine, and a thing composed of small parts is so spread out.
In the end, then, they distinguish the various other substances from the element by the greatness and smallness of their parts.
This method of distinction makes all judgement relative.
There will be no absolute distinction between fire, water, and air, but one and the same body will be relatively to this fire, relatively to something else air.
The same difficulty is involved equally in the view elements and distinguishes them by their greatness and smallness.
The principle of distinction between bodies being quantity, the various sizes will be in a definite ratio, and whatever bodies are in this ratio to one another must be air, fire, earth, and water respectively.
For the ratios of smaller bodies may be repeated among greater bodies.

Those who start from fire as the single element, while avoiding this difficulty, involve themselves in many others.
Some of them give fire a particular shape, like those who make it a pyramid, and this on one of two grounds.
The reason given may be-more crudely-that the pyramid is the most piercing of figures as fire is of bodies, or-more ingeniously-the position may be supported by the following argument.
As all bodies are composed of that which has the finest parts, so all solid figures are composed of pryamids: but the finest body is fire, while among figures the pyramid is primary and has the smallest parts; and the primary body must have the primary figure: therefore fire will be a pyramid.
Others, again, express no opinion on the subject of its figure, but simply regard it as the of the finest parts, which in combination will form other bodies, as the fusing of gold-dust produces solid gold.
Both of these views involve the same difficulties.
For (1) if, on the one hand, they make the primary body an atom, the view will be open to the objections already advanced against the atomic theory.
And further the theory is inconsistent with a regard for the facts of nature.
For if all bodies are quantitatively commensurable, and the relative size of the various homoeomerous masses and of their several elements are in the same ratio, so that the total mass of water, for instance, is related to the total mass of air as the elements of each are to one another, and so on, and if there is more air than water and, generally, more of the finer body than of the coarser, obviously the element of water will be smaller than that of air.
But the lesser quantity is contained in the greater.
Therefore the air element is divisible.
And the same could be shown of fire and of all bodies whose parts are relatively fine.
(2) If, on the other hand, the primary body is divisible, then (a) those who give fire a special shape will have to say that a part of fire is not fire, because a pyramid is not composed of pyramids, and also that not every body is either an element or composed of elements, since a part of fire will be neither fire nor any other element.
And (b) those whose ground of distinction is size will have to recognize an element prior to the element, a regress which continues infinitely, since every body is divisible and that which has the smallest parts is the element.
Further, they too will have to say that the same body is relatively to this fire and relatively to that air, to others again water and earth.

The common error of all views which assume a single element is that they allow only one natural movement, which is the same for every body.
For it is a matter of observation that a natural body possesses a principle of movement.
If then all bodies are one, all will have one movement.
With this motion the greater their quantity the more they will move, just as fire, in proportion as its quantity is greater, moves faster with the upward motion which belongs to it.
But the fact is that increase of quantity makes many things move the faster downward.
For these reasons, then, as well as from the distinction already established of a plurality of natural movements, it is impossible that there should be only one element.
But if the elements are not an infinity and not reducible to one, they must be several and finite in number.
