## Part 6

First we must inquire whether the elements are eternal or subject to generation and destruction; for when this question has been answered their number and character will be manifest.
In the first place, they cannot be eternal.
It is a matter of observation that fire, water, and every simple body undergo a process of analysis, which must either continue infinitely or stop somewhere.
(1) Suppose it infinite.
Then the time occupied by the process will be infinite, and also that occupied by the reverse process of synthesis.
For the processes of analysis and synthesis succeed one another in the various parts.
It will follow that there are two infinite times which are mutually exclusive, the time occupied by the synthesis, which is infinite, being preceded by the period of analysis.
There are thus two mutually exclusive infinites, which is impossible.
(2) Suppose, on the other hand, that the analysis stops somewhere.
Then the body at which it stops will be either atomic or, as Empedocles seems to have intended, a divisible body which will yet never be divided.
The foregoing arguments show that it cannot be an atom; but neither can it be a divisible body which analysis will never reach.
For a smaller body is more easily destroyed than a larger; and a destructive process which succeeds in destroying, that is, in resolving into smaller bodies, a body of some size, cannot reasonably be expected to fail with the smaller body.
Now in fire we observe a destruction of two kinds: it is destroyed by its contrary when it is quenched, and by itself when it dies out.
But the effect is produced by a greater quantity upon a lesser, and the more quickly the smaller it is.
The elements of bodies must therefore be subject to destruction and generation.

Since they are generated, they must be generated either from something incorporeal or from a body, and if from a body, either from one another or from something else.
The theory which generates them from something incorporeal requires an extra-corporeal void.
For everything that comes to be comes to be in something, and that in which the generation takes place must either be incorporeal or possess body; and if it has body, there will be two bodies in the same place at the same time, viz.
that which is coming to be and that which was previously there, while if it is incorporeal, there must be an extra-corporeal void.
But we have already shown that this is impossible.
But, on the other hand, it is equally impossible that the elements should be generated from some kind of body.
That would involve a body distinct from the elements and prior to them.
But if this body possesses weight or lightness, it will be one of the elements; and if it has no tendency to movement, it will be an immovable or mathematical entity, and therefore not in a place at all.
A place in which a thing is at rest is a place in which it might move, either by constraint, i.e.
unnaturally, or in the absence of constraint, i.e.
naturally.
If, then, it is in a place and somewhere, it will be one of the elements; and if it is not in a place, nothing can come from it, since that which comes into being and that out of which it comes must needs be together.
The elements therefore cannot be generated from something incorporeal nor from a body which is not an element, and the only remaining alternative is that they are generated from one another.
