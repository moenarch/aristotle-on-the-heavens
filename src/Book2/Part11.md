## Part 11

With regard to the shape of each star, the most reasonable view is that they are spherical.
It has been shown that it is not in their nature to move themselves, and, since nature is no wanton or random creator, clearly she will have given things which possess no movement a shape particularly unadapted to movement.
Such a shape is the sphere, since it possesses no instrument of movement.
Clearly then their mass will have the form of a sphere.
Again, what holds of one holds of all, and the evidence of our eyes shows us that the moon is spherical.
For how else should the moon as it waxes and wanes show for the most part a crescent-shaped or gibbous figure, and only at one moment a half-moon?
And astronomical arguments give further confirmation; for no other hypothesis accounts for the crescent shape of the sun's eclipses.
One, then, of the heavenly bodies being spherical, clearly the rest will be spherical also.
